# Powerful-Graph-Embedder-preserves-orits-and-orders
The rest of project and theory will be added Soon..

The simple prototype: Unsupervied Learning in graph such that our embedding has alot of propareties such as presearve orbits(i.e., nodes have the same sturctural proparties) and 
embedding order(i.e., for all i in [d] for all u,v in V(G) z_u[i] >= z_v[i] iff u is super over v(def.))
